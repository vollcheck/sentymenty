1:08, imaginary arguments in the shower vibes.
Bet your ass I am 😁😁💪🙏
Excuse me miss Sia. Is this song a song about yourself? I enjoy the melody. but I really can't symphatize the lyrics that you are singing (or reading). When I read the lyrics of this song.. it makes me feel so unsymphatizable to the point where it sounds, slightly shocking to me. I would actually feel ackward to sing this song outwardly or even in my mind.
On a radio station I listen to there’s a different version with music that I don’t hear on this version.
Would have been cooler just seeing sia standing there. That dancer makes me feel like there is a real problem.
What a beautiful song..inspiring
Great song dumbass video
Love this song,not so stoked with the video 😂
Great F*cking Song, but The Music Video is Stupid AF! Js
This song is so annoying!!!!! Please take it off
Red did this better
Great song but one of the most stupidest videos I've ever seen
"I'm unstoppable" Famous last words of the dodos. :-)

Great song, stupid video
Great Song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a great performance by Gaby Hoffmann
Yeah, Good song, great message but...those pants, those fucking pants 😂🤣🤣😂
Yessssssssss!💜💜💜
This will be my song for years everytime I doubt myself and I feel weak. Thank you Sia for reminding me that I am Unstoppable, Powerful, and Confident.
Is this Sia dancing? It dosnt look like her.
I love the song but the video is kinda stupid.
I've always loved this song since I discovered it. However, after yesterday morning it has a new meaning for me. I took my male dog out back to potty & the area bobcat was outside foraging. 34-pounds & over 10 years old, the second Remi saw that bobcat he full tilt charged it w/ a DEEP growl. Thankfully the bobcat chose to run & didn't attack him. Remi absolutely had 0 hesitation in doing that to protect me & ensure I was safe.
the lyric and music of this song gives me a positive vibes of life. This song gives me a spirit and fight to get my dreams
🖤💖❤
This woman sure knows how to sing
❤️💪
DUMBO !!! 😹 so powerful.. that don't need battery 😹 I laugh from 2 days... my stomach hurt... 😹😹😹 chicks 🤣
Truly this song is my favorite through sickness and pain. And it gives me positive aspect that things will be alright. And this song is also my story through bullying because I'm a winner not a loser.....😊❣❣❣🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Buena letra, para un vídeo tan simplon.
I'm unstoppable. I'm invincible. I am half god. My enemies will fall. My will be done on earth.

Hey sweetheart

Great. Video 😍😉💯 luv. This song ‼️ 🎶💞
Most of you misunderstand the lyrics. It is about someone who can't show feelings and always hides to not get recognized, to not show how vulnerable he is.
Am a lover not a fighter, I feel invisible each time this song comes up.
This song give me fullpower
Great song weird video
Her songs all sound same
I saw her whole face
Is it just me or am I the only one who noticed how wide her pants are and she’s literally braking GLASS with her head
Your song is supalit With wonder women
Fantastic song. Terrible video.
Wow. What an amazing artist. I really enjoy sia. Instant classics from her. She will stand the test of time.
The song is good with very motivating, inspiring lyrics, but that outfit no
I’m watching this after finding Woody and I never gave up. Im glad you’re back with me now Woody. I’m tracking down whoever touched him
This song makes me like porsche
This song makes me wanna go out and kick someone's ass because I am fucking bored!
This song is so powerful love it an it should spread all over
No effects, no mastering, clear voice plz.
My own brother stole from me And My son - I’m a widow and 57-  but I get it!!!❤️❤️❤️
This song has made my start thinking more about talking better care of my own health. I know something is wrong, I’m going to get myself checked out 😢
Thought its Rihanna..
This song will be forever ruined by TikTok. Song is garbage
This song makes me think of all 3 of my daughters. They have all faced monsters in their lives and have never stopped fighting to defeat them ❤❤❤
Best running song
I literally had someone ride on my back and I went like a mile
超大掉ㄍㄚ就是現代藝術啦

Great song but this is the lowest budget piss poor video ever
Song is nothing about a distortion nothing's unstoppable.
This song gives me the motivation to get up in the morning and giving me the inspiration to live do to everyone around me constantly making me depressed and angry and suicidal all the time I listen to this song when I need the energy to keep fighting and not give up on life
TikTok brought me here.
This song is very powerful. The lyrics have so much meaning behind it that makes you want to never give up no matter are hard life gets
Everyone who says this video sucks isn't capable of other level thinking.  What if your only job was to smash your head through glass...but you couldn't do it without getting amped up first.  It's not about smashing glass with your head.  It's about doing anything that's your job because you put that armor on and smashed it.  The celebration dance afterwards is the reward.
Nice song but why put a loontard on the video?
Incredibly strong and meaningful song for a lot of people. I recently saw an interview of David Guetta speaking about Sia, and he mentioned that she doesn't want to sing, only write. Thanks the heavens she was convinced to sing this one.
Denne sangen er så utrolig jævla bra! Hilsen fra Norge
Ukraine's song right here !😉
goooooooodddddddddddddd but 1 thing this is girl or boy
Who else here because "Dakar motivation" video? :)
Is that Winona Ryder dancing?? 🤔 looks like her js
Every time I hear this song I randomly bash my head through windows, which I feel like is the message behind this song
Amo suas músicas 🎶
This is my motivational song for National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). It isn't easy writing a novel, and NaNoWriMo is the challenge of writing a 50,000 word story (200 pages for the month of November. Thank you, Sia for recording such an empowering song!
This song make me strong
Stupid video for a banging song.
I'm a masculine man and cannot be beat, but before every chemo I set in the hospital parking lot I cried and listened to this song just knowing I would be a whimpering piece of meat afterwards.
is that a dude?
Beautiful song — shitty video. Please, remake video.  🙏
This looks like it was filmed in the 80s.
I am praying for my friend who just diagnosed with lung cancer to fight back unstoppable and survive it!!!
This song is awesome... But the video kinda ruined it for me. I think of someone going through hard times and doing what they can to make it. ANYTHING YOU CAN TO STAY STRONG. Nothing stopping them.. But watching the Video I see a girl with weird huge prop pants smashing her head through glass???? Umm... Ok
Where's Maddie? I think she would have bought more energy to this video. She's so expressive with her dancing. I think she would have made this video less boring, imo.
c'mon Sia girl!!!

LOVE IT! If you want to rock out play it at 1.25 speed ❤❤❤
I love her music, her videos confuse me. I mean as soon as I heard this song, I pictured a future of clips where my daughters are breaking barriers. Like female athletes showing they are just as great and competitive as male counterparts.
Great song but weird video
THE GREAT I AM HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN. IN YOUR TIME OF DISTRESS, CRY OUT HIS NAME it is written. HE HAS NEVER EVER EVER LET ME DOWN, NOR WILL HE. HE IS THE KING OF FOREVER!GREATER IS HE WITHIN ME THAN WHATS WITHIN THE WORLD. NOTHING CAN TOUCH THIS KIND OF POWER. NOTHING FOREVER.
My son is at Boot Camp at Parris Island. This song gives me a boost when I'm worried or miss him which is all the time
This song sucks, another example of how modern day pop music is awful.
I do love the music but the video is horrible!!! We can do so much more with this song. It is so powerful.
This song has gotten so anboying
“I don’t need batteries to playyyyy” my favorite part :) I like the mix up in the vocals

Anyone else concerned about glass shards landing in those pants???
I'm obsessed with this song but I was expecting a better video for it she coulda done so much more for the music video it's such a powerful song I love it!!
WE ARE ALL STOPABLE..DON'T FOOL YOUR SELF
Wish I had armor like you - take on all challenges.

Such beautiful, empowering lyrics. Too bad she chews these via bad diction, on her CD and videos.

What is the hardest OBSTACLE you have to overcome?   When I was young, my biggest fear was not knowing if our family could survive without another meal. The feeling of seeing your mother and siblings not having food was tragic and I wish no kid have to go through that. Yes, it made me into who I am today, but it took years for me to overcome that nightmare.   One of the obstacles I took courage to overcome is rejection. I have been rejected many times over, but I did not listen to those who did not believe in me. Instead, I kept eyes focused on my goal of rising above poverty so I can help my family and other people.   Everyone has fears and obstacles they have to confront and they’re different for every person. Fight them, overcome them, and you will be surprised what is waiting on the other side. God bless everyone!  Manny Pacquiao word's🥊 Being born into poverty is not a choice. My siblings and I grew up with nothing. No food, no shelter, not knowing if we could survive another day without food. That did not stop me though. I always believed and still believe today that with hard work, determination, and perseverance you can defeat whatever obstacle is in front of you. I didn’t have time to be lazy. My family’s life was on the line. I could not just stand by and do nothing. I had to fight! :;  Top welterweight Boxing 🥊 Greatest Manny Pacquiao (62-7-3, 39KOs)    What defines you is not by how many times you’ve been knocked down, but by how you’ve learned from those knock downs and how you get back up.”  Someone said 👍 A  great boxer,He defeat poverty👍🙏💪💪💪  My Words 🤔  Nothing wrong standing up for yourself!

My favourite song Unstoppable she is so cute and she is never disappointed 🥺
Epic song. Wasted video.
Russians move to the borders, we respect fact you dont want to be involved or fight
Incredible that this song took more 4 years to finally get into the charts and the radio
Unstoppable love 💕 you Sia Very powerful message and urgent!! JESUS YESHUA CHRIST is the Lamb 🐑🩸 of GOD Blood on the Doorposts  It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes. Exodus 12:27  John 1:29 .... The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!   “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.” John the Baptist points us to the Apocalyptic Lamb, who hates sin and will eradicate it from the world. The Apostle John points us to the Sacrificial Lamb, who took on himself the penalty for sin due to his people, so that they might be saved  Revelation 12:11 11 And they overcame him ( SATAN) by the blood of the Lamb 🐑 ( JESUS), and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.  Remembering what has happened in the past has the power to lift our spirits and give us hope. And that’s exactly what the Israelites did when they celebrated Passover. The Passover commemorates what God did for the Israelites when they were in Egypt, oppressed by Pharaoh and his crew (Exodus 1:6–14). After they cried out to God, He delivered the people in a mighty way. He told them to put blood on their doorposts so the death angel would “pass over” their firstborn people and animals (12:12–13). Then they would be kept safe from death.   Centuries later, believers in Jesus regularly take communion as we remember His sacrifice on the cross—providing what we needed to be delivered from sin and death (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). Remembering God’s loving acts in the past gives us hope for today.  REFLECT & PRAY How can you celebrate what God has done on your behalf? How can you offer hope to others from your past experiences?  I thank You, loving God, for all the marvelous works You’ve done on my behalf. Please give me the strength to focus on Your mighty acts when I need hope to keep going.  SCRIPTURE INSIGHT The point of the first Passover was substitutionary death: a spotless lamb sacrificed in place of the firstborn son. As with all elements of worship prescribed in the Old Testament, this points to the future Messiah who would be the once-for-all sacrifice for the entire human race. At the Passover observance we now know as the Last Supper, Jesus said, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins” (Matthew 26:28). Hebrews 9:26 explains that “[Christ] has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.” The writer to the Hebrews concluded, “So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him” (v. 28).  Part 2 Blood on the Doorposts  Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household… Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs… The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt. – Exodus 12:3-4, 6-7, 12  What was the significance of putting blood on the doorposts? One very important thing to realize is how it foreshadows the future shedding of blood of Christ, that protects us from judgment, just as the blood here protected the families from judgment.  But yet, the act of putting blood on the doorposts says other things as well. One is that it was a public commitment to the God of Israel in that hostile land, in which that kind of sacrifice was an abomination, which would lead to the person’s being stoned (Ex. 8:26). Only those that were convinced that God would triumph over the Egyptian gods would have done so because of fear of public execution.  Also, putting the blood on the doorposts was a mark of faith that apparently was not limited to Israelites, but anyone who placed his or her faith in God. The text says that many others left Egypt with the Israelites (Ex. 12:38) – perhaps they too had claimed this God by marking their homes. Even some of Pharaoh’s officials feared the Lord – could some of them have even done it? Interestingly, entire homes and families were saved, just as in the New Testament, entire families were baptized and saved (Acts 16:34). Even Rahab the harlot was able to save her family by marking her home with a scarlet cord! (Josh. 6:25) The Bible often talks about salvation in terms of families, while we think in terms of individuals.  Finally, it is amazing that God told people to make a sacrifice and put the blood on their homes. Normally sacrifices were made at an altar in a tabernacle or temple, and only the ceremonially clean could enter in. God’s great shekinah glory would be very present at the altar, apart from the rest of the people. Here, God was telling them to anoint their home as God’s altar, and publically place their faith in him. God’s presence came that night and to those who did not fear him, it lead to judgment. But to those who had faith, it would set them free.
Sia Always has These Encouraging, Pick myself up,not giving up,fighting, warrior Mentality!  Sia never disappoints,never makes shit, Always, Amazing 👏 Motivating Music! it's more than music,it's like a New Mentality, New Strength! That Extra Push u Need in Life! Thank u Sia 💓

She looks like mimiyuh 😭
Thanks Mubi
how is this an official video, audio is so bad, is this a joke?

best song i am always depressed even suicidal, and this song saved my life
The song is great. The video is stupid.
Thank you I will rise above the ASHES AND FIND THE END OF THIS DARK TUNNEL TO THE END WHERE THE LIGHT IS !
The song is 😍😍, but the video is 🤢🤢
Why the video had a shitty quality 🤔🤔🤔 make you feel it's an old video from the 80s
This song’s video could have went plenty of different routes. This one is interesting.
Chicks weird
Corny ass song
Even though most of her music sounds similar, they always get me and the lyrics just motivate my depressed arse every time. ❤️❤️❤️
Baru tau 2022, gara" sering banged jd backsound..
When you feel like shit and you go for a run, shits amazing
GREAT SONG 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This video is lame compared to the song.
Голос похож на Риану 🙌 супер.
Illuminati songs feels energy.. coz they are include the black magic in this song
Hear this song when I'm lost of direction ,feel hopeless like feel there is no way out.. it's brings back the confident of ourselves, no matter what u are powerful in your own way.
Where’s Maddie?
With a song like this, it should've had a great video.  Instead of this horse-shit.
Who is the dancer?
Tremenda voz bien arriba!!!
Such a clean song after decades !!
All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time Oh yeah Oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear It's never the right time Yeah, yeah I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am I'm unstoppable I'm a Porsche with no brakes I'm invincible Yeah, I win every single game I'm so powerful I don't need batteries to play I'm so confident Yeah, I'm unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today Break down, only alone I will cry on out You'll never see what's hiding out Hiding out deep down Yeah, yeah I know, I've heard that to let your feelings go Is the only way to make friendships grow But I'm too afraid now Yeah, yeah I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am I'm unstoppable I'm a Porsche with no breaks I'm invincible Yeah, I win every single game I'm so powerful I don't need batteries to play I'm so confident Yeah, I'm unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today I put my arm around, show you how strong I am I put my arm around, I'll show you that I am I'm unstoppable I'm a Porsche with no breaks I'm invincible Yeah, I win every single game I'm so powerful I don't need batteries to play I'm so confident Yeah, I'm unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today Unstoppable today I'm unstoppable today
Faced heart break and overcome it, , face  homelessness and overcome it,  faced loneliness and overcome it, faced jail and overcome it, faced death and overcome it . Faced everything and rise 💪
Incredible song.. Incredible vocals but something seems to be missing in the video ,Where's Maddie Z....?
Love this song, the music video is weird, but love the power of the lyrics.
This song gets me through my rough times at work.
How come this song is back on the billboard hot 100?  Was is it featured in a TV show or a movie?
I have been reclusive after a really bad few years. I literally put this song on and went out. It sounds silly but the power of song and music are  real
Silly video for such a powerful song.
This song for sure has a different meaning to it she has to put armor on to show you how strong she is? no way strong comes from within cause not even the best crafted armor can shield you from your biggest fears when you drown in it. Correct me if I'm wrong folks🤔😇🤣
She’s unstoppable today but what about yesterday or tomorrow. Don’t take this comment seriously. It’s just a joke. No offense.
The song could be good, but Sia just played too odd in these days of her career.
Who else came here from S22 Ultra Trailer
Песня отличная,а вот клип можно было снять лучше
I‘ve truly manifested so many great things in my life, just by singing this song out Loud everyday!!! energy Shift!
Sia videos are disturbing and moving at the same time. Almost all of them make me want to weep.
Sesuatu banget dengan lagu ini ya.. video nya juga ada yang aneh kayaknya
Worst video in a long time!  Headbutting glass?? Lol
This video is stupid 4 this song
Jesus is returning soon Get right with God Make yourself ready to meet God 💜⌛
I like this song , but I don't like this clip , Do it again SIA
I hate this song guys, do you hate this too?
Motivation speech meeting motivational song ❤️
👌🏻👌🏻
In my opinion i so much love this song, but the video is weak.
Who thought this video was a good idea... great song... but.... really...
I like sia but it's like she's trying to be lady Gaga. Sia is better than that.
Weil sie die Stimme hat und singen kann! Geil! Der Song gibt mir gerade Kraft ...
I have just been diagnosed with cancer for the 2nd time in 9 months. I'm going to beat it just like I did before.

I love this song but its some kind scary 😶
I am a cult survivor in the US who had to cut off contact with my family members who are in the cult still due to abuse. I absolutely love this song, I just have to sing along with it whenever I hear it. Thank you for empowering us Sia!
So amazing
a Super Powerful song to soul through the ears, with an Immensely Awful video, Zontrona for eyes ! Literally disturbs the amazing feel that the song has already created!
everytime feeling down, just hear this song and feel powerfull
The song is good the video is way below the song unfortunately, this song deserved a better video my opinion much better
Great Song with a mega Hookline ... the Video is atypical ... but this all is art ... we all need more of such good things .... many greetngs to all says: Liquid Noise
❤️
Amazing song - with the worst possible official video ever made in history. It shows how the producer is completely out of touch and has no understanding of the powerful lyrics and vocals behind it. The video is competely disconnected and uninspiring. Pathetic production
Is the girl Maddy from Sia's other videos?
❤❤💕💕💕💕

Questa canzone da una carica mostruosa! I love you Sia ❤️
After losing my mother, I became very lonely.   The responsibility of the old father is on me.  I am terrified thinking about the future. I have many responsibilities that I can no longer fulfill. I just think I can't. I don't feel good anymore.   I want to go somewhere far away.  I don't know when or where I heard this song.   I just want to listen, I feel strong. Thanks Sia. Expecting more songs like this. From India 🙏
Best motivation to ukrain👍
Honestly I think this is her best song yet
Pro-choice rally anthem.

One of the Most annoying Mainstream Tracks ive Heard. They Play this track dead in the Radios in Germany. Every hour you hear this track. Its really Lame  Pop music after the Same Formula again and again. Uninspired, melodramatic, and tired

Thank you sia for making my favorite song
How much money does the German car factory invest?

Why video clips looks like 320p?
La canción es increíble pero el videoclip deja mucho que desear . Yo pondría un auto deportivo súper potente compitiendo con otro por otro lado pondría algo así como un muro golpeado por algo siendo destrozado . ☝️
I DIDNT know this was old
Bad music video for such a nice song
I love the song but don't like the video

By far my most favourite song from Sia!!!. This video does not give the song justice though...not sure what she was thinking? Very bland.

Love the song. But I wish I hadn't seen this video.
i was on Tik Tok and noticed this song showing up as a theme song for ukraine citizens defending themselves seeing the husband kiss wife and kids good bye as they left for poland, as veteran myself seeing that sunk in deep and the song with it, i looked up sia and her bio and the things she went through in her life but kept going, gave me a better understanding of her as a person
Energetic
This song makes  me confident Thank,s Sia
♥♥
Who came here after watching samsung ad ??
Your music unstoppable once it play. Love your music and voice.
This song is so appropriate for Rafael Nadal in 2022. Whenever Nadal wins in a final, they play this track as everyone knows he is unstoppable and invincible. Vamos Rafa
The lyrics are great the video not so much
This song gives me immense strength to do any task when I'm tired...
Russia is on fire 🔥😍😍..... congress must learn something from this who lost our valuable land and become dalala (prostitue) of china and Pakistan but now India is in safe hand then previous spineless and brainless govt

wow what a great song! You will really feel good after listening this song when you feel hopless, stressful. This song make your mind more energetic & keep you with positive vibes. 💓💓💓💖  Caution - You will become addicted after listen this song.
I am from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 , and love 8-10  reels songs like faded, believer, alex n rus etc. But Sia is my most favorite song . I always prefer to listen courageous and daring songs. 🦁🦁🦁 🔱🔱🔱 .
I like and dislike!🌐📳📴📵🤳😃
Came after hearing song in samsung mobile phone ad.
Love this song but video sucks lol
Everyone's saying this song is motivational, but why do I sense such a depressing tone behind it?
Should have reserved this song for the Eurovision and I'm sure we will win the contest. Maybe they should consult Sia to compose a song for next year!

Who's here because of  Samsung S22 ????
90% people from Samsung s22 ultra trailer
Lagu yg sangat bagus untuk di dengarkan, tapi kenapa dengan video klip yang sangat hancur seperti ini, siapakah sutradara video klip nya ?
WHY THIS SONG HASN'T REACHED A MILLION LIKES PEOPLE COME HERE TO WATCH & LEAVE WITHOUT LIKING AAH!😮‍💨? IN FACT IT DESERVES 5M LIKES HONESTLY❤
This song hits differently
Who is from Samsung Galaxy S22 series?
This video doesn’t fit this song at all
Why this song is so underrated?
я пісня моя посвята всім жінкам українського народу, які воювали на війні // ta piosenka jest moją dedykacją dla wszystkich walczących w wojnie kobiet narodu ukraińskiego // this song is my dedication to all women of the Ukrainian nation who fought in the war  Sia - rok 2016 z albumu This is Acting - dzisiaj ten utwór nabiera całkowicie innego wymiaru, sensu i przekazu, niestety wpasowuje się w realia wojny na Ukrainie i informacjach dotyczących wstępowania w szeregi armii Ukraińskiej i formacji obronnych kobiet, które oprócz swoich ojców, mężów i braci także walczą z okupantem rosyjskim.   слава  України героям  слава !!!

Samsung girl
Samsung galaxy s22 5g
"Samsung S22 Ultra"
💪💪💪
I like how real and relatable this song is. While the song seems about empowerment, it also portrays the fear of vulnerability in some people and why they do. We often put on a tough exterior to hide our insecurities. We don't want others to know what these flaws are because we know how cruel some people can be to those who are weak and we have been too traumatized with their brutal invalidation of our struggles. I'm not saying this is bad but we shouldn't shut our hearts for too long. We may not realize the dangers of wearing this mask for a long time but it is indeed exhausting, and if it becomes too much, it overtires you to the point of collapsing. It wrecks us in the long run. Saying "I'm unstoppable" is how some of us empower and motivate ourselves and that is great. But also being able to show our vulnerable side and accepting help from others will make us a lot stronger and freer.
Эта песня придатет мне силы жить дальше
i've thought this song called S22 - Ultra
Perfect anthem of the modern feminofascism that we're living
this is what trying new pants feels like.
I love her... this song is so reminiscent of "my life" song Titanium.
SAMSUNG SIA ( galaxy S 22 )
Here after the Samsung s22 commercial
Shook when samsung use this song as their campaign song for s22!
I come here after listening to Samsung S22 ads
This is not a song This is a feeling of positivity
Let's hear this song after s22 ultra ad..
I can't believe this song...That lyrics are amazing .....
Such an inspiring song 🙏🏻♥️
❤️💫
All time favorite 🖤🖤🖤
I'v researched the whole internet to find a  solution to my self esteem issues. This song gave me hope better than anything I read 😢
This song depend on me
I love this song and love the empowerment...but when she says break down, only alone I will cry on out, you’ll never see what’s hiding out, hiding out deep down- makes me think she suffers and doesn’t feel like she can tell anyone? And  ...but I’m too afraid now about re: friendships,  so as someone who has struggled & suffered in silence , it feels like a not so subliminal way to say deep down she is in pain
I love you Sia amazing song 🎵 ❤ you are awesome 😍
Omg The Song is my Favoriten Song❤
I am unstoppable 🙅🙅
This song is so powerful and wonderful, thanks Sia for make all of us be strong in our life 😊😊👍👍
This Song IS Amazing!!! WOW  I Likey  😃😃

Yes it's hard very hard when you know your lover is fading from you sight and you can't do anything. You just can cry and make your pillow wet... You you start Recolecting old days when you both used love each other...

Such a chilling song and an equally weird video 💯
Лошадки конечно  красиво  бегают, но так себе когда  посмотрел

my all time favorite SIA
TBH  Literally This Song Is Made For Tony Stark AKA Iron Man AKA RDJ ❤
weird video,, super great song,,, super great voice... help me get trough tough reality every single morning..
I got this song yesterday on someone WhatsApp status. I use it to celebrate my convocation 2 days ago after I spent 8 years in University in spites of all odds . Thank you sia
The energy that this song gives me is amazing. I'm listening to it endlessly. I did a 30 minute workout in the morning and had body aches. After listening to the song, I did 35 minutes of treadmill work on the same day, which was like pushing my limits and bringing out the best in me. <3
Thanks for the boost
Gosto da cantora Sia, mas acho bem melhor a versão dessa música pela banda Red! Um alô aqui do Brasil!✌🇧🇷🇧🇷
This turned me on. I had a cricket match, where I could get only 10 run. After listening to this, I started to practice and in the final match I acquired 128 run and became the man of the match.
this is..sing a song support my life..! nice.
This song send me power and i feel unstoppable and powerful!❤️
Please Don't Listen this song when driving 🤣🤣🤣
I let my cat hear this song, he's now a dog.
Made it for TikTok
Why do people find this song empowering???? I related to this song most at my most broken state. The lyrics are clearly displaying someone who is in turmoil and desperately lonely because they don't feel like they're allowed to take their armor off and let people know them. Like them must appear perfect and unstoppable. This song is so sad. Even the "Porsche with no brakes" line. You know what happens to a Porsche with no brakes? It crashes at top speed. The people inside are injured or killed. Anyone who thinks this is empowering doesn't pay attention to any of the lyrics except part of the chorus.
Fire
Once in our lifetime we come across some real assholes who's only intention is to put you down but believe me now they are nowhere to be found. I am unstoppable today
El vídeo no me cuadra. Pero la canción tiene demasiada energía, me encanta
Countless times when Sias songs saved... helped... you just feel the energy. Be strong!!! Sia thank You, world need more people like U💗
Novak Djokovic- unstoppable
This song was made for Iron man.
Enthusiastic song 🙏 🙌
better with 1.25x I promise
So this song is directed on men? Because the person shuttering the glass with their head is clearly a guy, lol.
It is my new favourite song 🥺 when i hear this song everytime i feel motivated and its a great voice
Tak terbendung seperti porche tanpa rem..tak terkalahkan sperti pemenang di tiap pertandingan..bertenaga tak perlu baterai
Very like it👍😍😍😍
What a song, and the lyrics hits👊 different.
Thanks to TikTok I finally got this😆😆
You go girl you got this 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Awful vid, great song. These artists should get ice skaters to these music videos XD  (Yes, I just came here from watching some ice skaters using this song in their acts)
Idk why the lyrical unofficial video has more views than the original music video ☹️☹️
It's 2022 who's here to listen this song❤️
Every one should proud of yourselves by listening this song
Unstoppable ✨
Love the song.
Love the song but the video is so stupid.

Who else came here for this song after hearing it on Instagram?
This song makes me wanna jump off a cliff im so confident
I was listening to this song today when i was riding my yamaha fzs V2. Sometimes later i noticed that i was on 132kmph speed. Ignore this song when you're driving. it might boost your confidence and speed together.
Fact real 1st time hearing this song January-07-2022,09:10pm official music video after release 3 years ago. Heard short videos memes Instagram that lead me to actually hear unstoppable. How did I not watched
P o modlitbě je tato skladba jedna z nejkrásnějších co mi dává chuť lépe vnímat život, je super🥰
Good vibes.
When i listen this song make me more confidence🙂
Lord those pants!
❤❤❤
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, I get reminded of this song ❤
Best song forever
Song is incredible but not the visual
Yesterday me and my boys moved some 2ton steel on this music...
It was plastic ha
The glass breaking was not true zo not true you were going to be bleeding if you were going to break class that is so not true ha
I play this song with my Dog, he is now a Wolf. 🔥🔥🔥
Me sinto afundando em um infinito mar quando ouço esta musica

anyone here in 2022
I have heard songs with a billion views nowhere near as good. Views don't matter. Quality does!
In my life, a lot of things went wrong. I've been at my lowest point twice in my life. I frequently feel like a failure and consider quitting this life. Until I hear this song.. This song changed my life and helped me resurrect my spirit.   Thank you so much, Sia❤
I am a life long metal head but the first time I heard this chorus through a short video on Instagram and fell in love with it. Not knowing this genre of music at all I thought it was Rihanna singing 😂🤷‍♂️ don’t know why because I couldn’t tell you a single name to one of her songs.  They keep belting out powerful music like this n they’ll explode if they already haven’t 😂🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Me encanta esa canción incita a la auto superación y a la forma de enfrentarse a la vida pero lastimosamente el video deja mucho que desear pareciera un capítulo de jackass
Siapa yg kesini karena tik tok??
Love the song but the video is trash. Geezus... She could have rocked it. She could have made this a women's anthem... She could have been so much more creative but the video is awful. Excellent song though.
I am listening this song since morning continuously ❤️
great song..horrible satanic cabal inuendos video production..
This song a recomended from bung Towel for Timnas Indonesia
Porsche brought me here. A frickin porsche without a single brake.
As a nurse, this song is my jam.
This song gives me a vision, i am at the top of the 'WORLD'. I am UNSTOPPABLE 💫. Thank You SIA 🌹❤️🌹.
Dont know why, each time i hear this songs, felt goosebumps all over my body, tears drops falling unknowingly, dnt know why felt so emotional... Dont know
'I'll tell you what you wanna hear' Can it be more badass✨
Damn. Did Paul Walker died on a fast moving Porsche which the breaks did not work? 01:51
Manifesting the indomitable legend within me ✨
Thank you ✌ ❤

Estella? Cruella?
I love vibe too and I especially enjoy watching mothers and her children on instagram while this music is playing.  Love the reference of mother lioness protecting her cubs and human mothers portraying protection over their children.  While we see children assaulted by leftist freaks hell bent on indocrination, mothers acting as fearless lioness watching their cubs.  Good job Mothers and Fathers!!!

Kitna bakwaas video
Song beautiful. But ... Wtf is the video about??????? It is terrible ! Disgusting! There was already a video with a couple dancing so beautiful... What message do you want to transmit showing this glass breaking? Only a mad or drunk would do such thing. This is dark ...... We know what you're doing... Now explain to the people who don't notice yet
Till now I have seen this video more than 100+ times is this is unstoppable ❤️❤️❤️
Gaby Hoffmann 👍very impressively dancer Кому интересно. Габи Хоффман - актриса, героиня этого сюжета

Song is great. The video is lame.
I just don’t understand why all of her videos so strange and nonsense kinda even painful to watch
Unstoppable ❤️
I Can't Listening to this song since 2016 i can't unstoppable
Horrible la wea de video xd
I'm from Kashmir and we are living under cruel extremist indian government.this song gives me hope
🎼 Хорошая музыка на ночь   "Unstoppable" ("Неудержимая") - песня австралийской певицы и автора песен Sia. Релиз вышел 21 января  2016 года.  🛡Эмили Линднер из MTV сказала, что это «побуждает тех, кто чувствует себя слабым, надеть доспехи».    Я надену броню, Чтобы показать тебе свою силу, Я надену броню, Чтобы показать тебе, кто я.
She looks very odd but her voice is stunning
Unstoppable sia ❤️
Im a addicted person,(drugs) This songs gave me strength,power,energy,, Please pray for me
This is hilarious far better than despacito 💘💘
If you're struggling in Life and think listening this will help you come out of it, then you're wrong. This is temporary drug/relief. Don't get me wrong here, but bring real spirituality in Life. That's the real cure. Listen to enlightened masters of the past and present. Go for sustainable solutions, not temporary ones. To prove my point analyse the lyrics of this song and you'll see how reckless a porche without break would be! That's death or stagnation. Choose wisely. Become spiritual. Please help yourself. 🙏
Sia💕😻
woooooooooooooooooo i am unstoppable todayyyyy
If she's so confident, why does she hide behind a wig?
Tomorrow is my exam so i need some motivation and blessings 🤕🤕
Why this is in my recommendations after 3 years
Is there any limit of madness 🤔  But song is awesome.
When ever I blow my  account I listen to this song it gives me courage 🤞
I got rejected by the person for whom I can think. ...I can do anything anytime ...now iam doing it for myself ...
Heard this on a fragrance commercial with Zendaya.
This song such fucking 😱😱😱fear
Music that literally broke the Internet
This song make me feel so strong to continue my life. Thanks SIA. Love you so much ♥️

It's Impossible for Sia to put out a song that doesn't bring back memories. She's the greatest female artist to have ever been. And yes mother fuckers that includes Adele who is the absolute shit next to most enyone and everyone else who isn't Sia
Everyone: you are Unstoppable and Unconditional Love, no matter what, never forget that. I love you all.
Lyrics perfect for Cristiano ronaldo😎👽

She doesn't get a scratch wile Women get killed everyday. Unbelievably far from reality and everyday life. shallow video which doesn't have a clue of being a woman. It would just work for white women from high classes of society.

Depression makes a great character, an indomitable character makes a character that guards not to break people with her words because she is really broken and knows the meaning of breaking from the heart that only high-end people understand mixed with pain, hope and strength

Did she just break the glass ceiling with her face? And laugh?
U r a gem...❤️ from 🇧🇩
3 years still watching this your a legend
Liked the stanza but then finally listened to the whole song's lyrics several times.  Odd, I was raised that choosing vulnerability while still being strong was courage.  Then watched the video seeking context clarity...girl keeps banging head into glass while wearing ill fitting pants.  Now, it all makes sense...less.  Next!

Great song
I found my favorite song,
laguny berdamage banget😭
What a unbareble disappointing video to an anthem like That.   I feel so very embarrassed to have loved this song like no other... Until I found out about sias opinions on us autisic ppl. I must say I'm worried about Maddy. Sias a Psychopath. Maddy run! You have enough to make it on your own don't let her tear you down further!
Sia voice is amazing if u don't like this voice then I tell u God ll punish u
I like dis song its my preferated song
<3
I like this beautiful unstoppable song ❤️❤️❤️
Bring goosebumps
❤️🥀
honestly this song brings an emotional vibe to the spirit of the self 🔥❤️
Love the song but the video just doesn't go with the song at all for me, they could have made it so much better but the entire video is her just hitting break away glass with her head while wearing pants that's 5 times her size, such a disappointment because I love this song so much and I was ready for a really badass meaningful video 🤦‍♀️😩

أشعر أن الفيديو كليب غير مناسب للأُغنية يجب أن يكون الفيديو كليب  أجمل بكثير وفيه قوة أكبر I feel that the video clip is not suitable for the song must be a much nicer video clip and a larger power

most underrated song ever... 😑😑     i love this song.... 🥰😍🥰🥰
I’m a Porche with no brakes….   Hmm dear Sia, you should look at PERODUA Myvi from Malaysia.. That can, can fly, with no brakes, and still look fine 😹😹😹
Very nice tune.
八卦打算半个忐忐忑忑
Великолепный голос.  Люблю её слушать.  Клип ужасный. Можно понять многое по клипу.  Накипело,  надоело,  не хочу быть привлекательной,  но я должна быть неуязвимой,  и я буду ей, и я такая есть.  Мир не на столько хорош,  что бы быть расслабленной и получать удовольствие от простоты и внутренней свободы? Не обязательно быть несокрушимой, и разбивать башкой придуманные миром барьеры.  Достаточно быть собой и любить себя за это.
Sia is UNSTOPPABLE ❤🔥
Ini anak kecil nya udah gede apa ya?
beautiful wonderful always looked for music now I found. it's like you said we must be invincible I never gave up 😘. Hello, I'm from Brazil

Combating a heart of glass means you saw it but were not able to reach in. Heart grab bags mean there is a disconnect. Is the connection your head? Really. Ready. Same thing. The difference is you only used an instinct while the trapper was not mindful. A superior animal. The trap is still out there catching others? Wow. Entertainment.

From tik tok  I'm here
When my girlfriend said "it's Up to You, by" her mind "IM UNSTOPPABLE TODAY!"
Love
The music video has a lot to say.   The girl at first prepares for impact. The reason for her to wear bulky trousers, to show that, no matter what burden is there, they will fight.  Then she after breaking some more glasses looks at a drawing. The drawing was done in a very old time. The girl looking at old painting shows and the lyrics "I don't need batteries", suggests  that  people who are unstoppable, don't need a constant source of motivation, because if your goals are strong enough, you'll do it, even if the odds are not in your favour. And, you are like a matchstick, a small spark and you can light anything. But then after breaking few more obstacles, the girl comes across a glass. She goes near the glass, indicating that the glass is stronger than previous, and using her old methods won't satisfy her. She then licks the glass indicating that, she has put a mark on the obstacle, and she will prepapre for a newer method to break the glass. She does find a newer method, and breaks the glass. And, the reason she was jumping indicates her actions that involved- not stopping at that point, and challenging herself to fight with more.  The people keep bringing obstacles, because without them, we can never know who is stoppable and who is not Ultimately, the whole video goes with breaking obstacles with no ending.  The video can have many meanings to different people, This was the meaning I learnt at first  So, the moral we learned is " Everyone is Stoppable, but unstoppable are those, who even after stopping do not give up"  And....sorry for the Bad English :')
I've found my morning coffee.
This song reminds me of how all of us are unstoppable
Nice video
I lope you😍

I feel like Sia sees less of the world than any other human being (that is not blind) can ever.
Cool song

For those who don’t know this video is the Performance Edit of Unstoppable just like how cheap thrills has one but this one is not yet officially released by Sia, that’s why this video is bad quality because it’s Fan made/edited, and the Performance Edits are videos that played on the big screen during Sia’s tour and they showed what’s happening on stage
Любимая песня 💗
I love itttttt
Une grande artiste aux talents multiples.
Bu ne biçim klip yaaa. Güzelim şarkının içine anca bu kadar edilebilirdi😏 tebrikler şarkıyı mahvetmeyi başarmışsınız👏
Amazing good job
Voce, canzoni, autrice sublimi
is that a girl that breaking a glass using head?
Hi Ana
Silvester 2020 dabei
For those musically intelligent, the song is written in Minor Chords, no matter how much I listen to it many times, it sounds Metal than Pop to me, and add the awesome Vocals. You got a perfect form of music compared to other Pop music.

Medvedev vs Nole: I'm so powerful. Medvedev vs Nadal: I'm invincible. Medvedev vs Dom: I'm unstoppable today.
.. schizophrenia at All ..
I have never looked up a picture of SIA, which is crazy because thinking back on it ive always wondered what she looked like, anyways, I finally looked her up after watching this video 2 weeks ago and omg, I was NOT expecting her to be that age.....she sounds like mid 20s beautiful
Alguém sabe quem é essa pessoa quebrando vidros com a cara? Tenho a impressão de tê-la/lo  visto antes
So 👌 i am thinking she will get nobel prize👏
This original video did not got views...but lyrics video got views

I love this song
Good song
Lo que hace Sia me parece arte, es impresionante
Why the video quality is so low?
💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
Estou passando por um momento muito difícil, com depressão, ansiedade e baixa auto estima..e minha professora me enviou essa música e agora estou em choro..ainda acredito que posso ser essa mulher incontrolável , incontrolávelmente feliz
Zendaya? 🐎
Yes i am unstoppable in Jesus Mighty Name!! Never should i fear
pouquoi Maddie ziegler n'est pas dans le clip.....!!!!
UNSTOPPABLE!!!
This song is used for a lot of movie characters.  Example: Supergirl, Black Canary, Black Widow, Mia Smoak. For they I am here. The original is very good, too.
I love it!the best song for me for ever and ever!i I m sending you only love from Greece!
This song represents how I feel right now!
Put this song on repeat all day long. It help me get started and kept on going strong at the times i needed to  be
this song makes me so emotional, weak but strong at the same time
Cool she was breaking glass with her head and she wan not even bleeding
Play it on 1.25 speed . It' sounds better
Ooh!!! This song revealed my stronger self!!!
Im here because im having a sis marathon
что там делает робот Вертер?
2020..Sia.. 🌎🌎🌎
is this vevo about how the girl can break glass with her head ToT ToT ToT ToT
Dude... This song helped me get more confident, I didn't socialize when I was younger I would rather stay alone, but thank to Sia I became better at socializing 🥰
LOVE SIA 😍😍😍😍 Sia
Originalidade total. Musica perfeira.
Not a fan of the video, but love the song.
This song gives a energy blast in my inner self🔥
Sis ur the best
Is that Maddie?????
Is that dancing girl still Maddie Ziegler? I think she is beautiful...(special)
I found Asia's music very inspiring so that we never give up
Is the best song
Was that a man or woman hitting their head?
sia is finally in the music vid
RED made a cover of this song, its an incredible song
Sia 🐐?
2020 SIA has two new albums coming out 🎤 she is so amazing and sounds great live what a great lady 🌹.
She goes and break glass with her head many times.
Ncis anyone?
OMG! Here we are in July 2020 and this is my song! 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙  who loves this song like me?
\o/
I hope i have a life where background music is this song. What a dream.
I like the song but I feel it’s Suit Rihanna more than Sia.
La amooo tanto
she said she unstoppable when i pause the video
It blows my mind how a woman who is about 40 (at the time of recording) still sounds like she's in her 20s.  Her voice is amazing.
Prior to yesterday I thought RED originally sang this. So now I'm listening to this to see which one I like better, this one is good but I prefer RED singing it.
I love SIA......👏
This song is my catwalk song. And it's making me So confident
An edit video of Ariadna Gutierrez brough me here ^_^
This song is AMAZING!!!!
Such a nice song but the video clip is boring
La canción está bien, pero el vídeo clip es horroroso jaja
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️

J'adore grave,merci Sia.

Quien en junio del 2020
Shame maddie wasn’t the dancer

What's the meaning of the video clip (NOT the song) The song is great.  But the video clip? What's that...?  It's awful.
Amazing!!! ♥️

Pioupioupipuopiou
Song's great but...Sia is Maddy...Maddy is Sia
Is it my phone or this does not looks in 4k?
Am I the only one here who thinks Lancome's advertising got any better than the music video?
0:33 Why does she look like Dancing Smarty Pants? 🤣
Videoclip so powerful... 💟
I feel like there is nothing I can’t do in this world when I’m listening to this song, love Sia
What a powerful and encouraging song!
This great song has a lousy video that's why the Wonder Woman video is worth seeing
Essa mulher só tem música boa
Wow👍💝
Idole = Lancome 💓

Очень сильная песня заряжает энергией действительно неудержимая ! Обожаю Сию 👍👍👍💯

Great song but the ugliest video that  I've never seen
Sia looks like a man whose skin is going out
Diavol
Lancôme add someone?😂😂
Idole =Lancome💖
Un chef d'œuvre !
why is this music video official if it is not on the Sia's channel?
Adoro !!!
Very beautiful Song
Am I the only one that thinks this is a satirical song about someone getting confidence from sniffing coke.
И мне,также,не приходилось видеть более оригинального и необычного самовыражения^ в клипе) Молодец! Песня сильная!
The first time I saw Sia I thought to myself, when did Lady Gaga become talented? Lol! No, but seriously Sia is an amazing singer and has to my mind the best voice currently out there.
Dieses Lied ist voll cool
Unstoppable 👊🏼
Solo vine por Zendaya
WTF
более оригинального клипа,чем этот,мне не доводилось видеть. Песня классная.
This song is just the best. Loving it any day
Best female vocalist there is =)
0:47 So SIA, for the first time directly appears in her music videos for the first time.
I love this song but this video is the worst ever
Охуенная певица !
i LOVE ! WONDERFUL SONG
Что за дичь я только что посмотрел??? Спайс отдыхает......
I love sia!!!
Maddie i think that kinda hurt you
Love ❤😘 sia. Like her non human feelings.
